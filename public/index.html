    <h2>Day 1- My thoughts on the web</h2>
      <p>The web has gone through an evolution throughout the years. Most of its evolution has been revamping features that work and trashing the ones that donâ€™t. The most fitting feature for the layout of web content is tables. With tables we can easily split up content into different sections and dividers. The magic of tables wears off after 5 minutes. Also, developers soon realized how ugly their pages looked and so they created CSS. CSS revolutionized the DOM and it made it easier to read the HTML code. Javascript became the game changing enhancer. It could create (annoying) pop-up windows that would give the web user the virtual experience of a lifetime.
      </p>
	    <p>Flash became a very flashy design feature. Animation, splash pages, and interactive effects gave life to web pages. Unfortunately, Apple rejected using Flash for web design and so flash became the lame thing Windows users updated every patch.  In 2007, the iPhone was released and the Mobile Uprising began which created a whole bunch of compatibility and design issues. Throughout the years more bugs have been fixed and now we can code to solve actual problems.
